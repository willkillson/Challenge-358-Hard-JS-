        <h1>[2018-04-25] Challenge #358 [Intermediate] Everyone's A Winner!</h1>
        <pre>Description
First they took our jerbs, now they're taking our puzzles! (with your help)

Today we're gonna find a way to solve jigsaw puzzles using computers

Input Description
As I am no designer the input will be purely numerical, feel free to make some visual version of the jigsaw puzzles :)

You will first be given the dimension as X, Y

Afterwards you will be given list of puzzle pieces and what type their 4 sides connect to (given as up, right, down, left)

Their side-connection is given as a number, They connect with their negated number

this means that a 1 and -1 connects, 2 and -2 connects etc.

0 means that it doesnt connect with anything.

Assume pieces are rotated in the correct direction.

fx:

2, 2
0: 0,1,2,0
1: 0,0,2,-1
2: -2,0,0,2
3: -2,-2,0,0
Output Description
Output is a 2D picture/matrix of the pieces in their correct position

for the example this would be

0 1
3 2
Challenge Input
Challenges are generated, so there is a slight chance of multiple solutions :P

Bonus
The pieces are randomly rotated and might need to be rotated to fit.

The example:

0: 0,1,2,0
1: 0,0,2,-1
2: -2,0,0,2
3: -2,-2,0,0
Could look like:

0: 0,1,2,0
1: 0,2,-1,0
2: 2,-2,0,0
3: -2,-2,0,0
